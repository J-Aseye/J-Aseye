✨ About Me

I am Joyce Abena Gbadago, currently a Technical Support Officer (Supporting flexcube and other core banking applications) with a completed BSc. Computer Sciene degree certificate


- 🔭 I discovered my new found love **(cloud computing)** through my boss who recommended it to me in an evaluation interview beause he insisted it would be a good fit for me. I have never had a regret with cloud computing a day since, though i am still new to the field. I achieved my **AWS Cloud Practitioner Certifiation** early on, Apri 2022 and finally aced and attained my **AWS Solutions Architect Certification** in 2024.


 🌱 I’m currently an alumni **Cloud Developer** at Udacity and even though it was a tough one, I am appreciative because it gave an added resource on what cloud services are, how to use them, the various options available to suit one's business needs and overall the served as the springboard to my career as an AWS Solutions Architect.
 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will challenge me on various use case scenarios of migrating businesses to the cloud, make use of other cloud services and leveaging cloud solutions to enhance sustainability and growth.

- ❤❤ I’m looking for roles in **Cloud Solutions Architecture or Consultancy** for companies that offer cloud services and solutions. This is my starting point as I advance in my career as a Solutions Architect.

- 💬 Ask me about females in Africa that work in IT 🙌 however much of the minority we may be 😁


- ⚡ Fun fact: I am the only female IT specialist currently in my office. Fun huh? 😘😊

I love to listen to good music, read books, watch tv shows in my spare time and travel whenever I have the chance to.
