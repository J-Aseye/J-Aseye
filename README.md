✨ About Me

I am Joyce Abena Gbadago, currently a Technical Support Officer (Supporting flexcube and other core banking applications) with a completed BSc. Computer Sciene degree certificate


- 🔭 I discovered my new found love (cloud computing) through my boss who recommended it to me in an evaluation interview beause he insisted it would be a good fit for me. I have never had a regret with cloud computing a day since, though i am still new to the field. I achieved my AWS cloud practitioner certifiation early on, Apri 2022 and looking on to the next, AWS Solutions Architect.


 🌱 I’m currently learning cloud dveloper at Udacity and even though it has been a tough one, i am appreciative because it gives an added resource on what cloud services are, how to use them, the various options available to suit one's business needs and overall the springboard to my career as an AWS Solutions Architect.
 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will challenge me on various use case scenarios of migrating businesses to the cloud, make use of other cloud services I have never been exposed to and colleagues who will be of great guidance to me as I advance in my career

- ❤❤ I’m looking for roles in technical support for companies that offer cloud services. This is my starting point as I advance in my career as a Solutions Architect.

- 💬 Ask me about females in Africa that work in IT 🙌 however much of the minority we may be 😁


- ⚡ Fun fact: I am the only female IT specialist currently in my office. Fun huh? 😘😊

I love to listen to good music, read books, watch tv shows in my spare time and travel whenever I have the chance to.
